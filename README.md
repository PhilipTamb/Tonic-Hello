# Tonic Example

Experimenting with Tonic and Protobuf

## Description

This project provides example code to experiment with Tonic and Protobuf. It serves as a practical introduction to using Tonic, a gRPC library for Rust, and Protobuf, a method for serializing structured data. Through this project, you will understand how to define and implement gRPC services using Tonic and Protobuf.
